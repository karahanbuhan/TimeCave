# TimeCave
Created for Ludum Dare 50. It’s our first game. In TimeCave, you play as a clockwork robot who is struggling with time. It has a wind up key on it’s back and that is the source of your life power. The key acts like a watermill under waterfalls to recharge it’s energy. Do you think you can delay death, or even something greater?

Controls are simple, you can hold [A/Left Key] to jump left or [D/Right Key] to jump right. Be careful with the charge amount though!

P.S. There may be audio glitches in web version so I recommend to download!

## About Ludum Dare
Ludum Dare is one of the world’s longest-running game development events, where creators from around the globe gather online to build small games in a very short time (usually 48–72 hours). The focus is on creativity, rapid prototyping, and sharing ideas with the community. After the event, participants play and rate each other’s games, giving valuable feedback and celebrating the variety of approaches that emerge from the same theme.
